# Project: StenNet

StenNet is an exploratory project into neural networks.  
The project features Hopfield networks that attempt to
recognize patterns that were previously trained.
StenNet takes input as image files and as text through
the console.

## Installation

This directory is an 
[Eclipse Mars IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/mars) 
Java project. The source files in `src` may be used in any Java
development space without need for any extra procedure. Usage in
Eclipse is best done by importing the project.

Included is `StenNet Dependency.jar`, a collection of classes
from Project: Case, a more thorough exploratory neural network 
engine.
