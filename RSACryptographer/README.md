# Project: RSACryptographer

RSACryptographer is a public-private key cryptography utility.  
`KeyPairUtility.java` offers functions for encrypting and 
decrypting
information with public-private keys as well as generating
key pairs of variable bit length. `CryptoUtility.java`
provides an encoding interface for changing strings into a
single Java `BigInteger`. Finally, `Demo.java` holds a 
console
demonstration of the project's functions. Further implementation
of the project may be assisted by analyzing the demo's source.

The project is complete to its specification, though lacks
complete documentation.

## Installation

This directory is an 
[Eclipse Mars IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/mars) 
Java project. The source files in `src` may be used in any Java
development space without need for any extra procedure. Usage in
Eclipse is best done by importing the project.

## Usage

`KeyPairUtility.java` offers documented methods for generating 
and using
cryptographic key pairs.
Interaction with the demo is done through standard input and 
output. Compile the project, run `Demo` and follow the 
prompts of 
the
utility.

## Contributing

The project is not accepting contributions at this time.
