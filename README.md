# cmorley191 Development Archive

This repository contains discontinued exploratory projects, games, 
and utilities. The archive exists for posterity's sake, as well
as a sort-of former portfolio of work - only the most well-developed
projects are included.

Each subdirectory holds a separate project. Simply access whichever
project you wish. See each project's `README.md` for its own 
description, installation, usage and licensing details.

Visit the [project wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/cmorley191/cmorley191-Development-Archive/wiki)
for detailed pages on each project (including details found in their
READMEs).
