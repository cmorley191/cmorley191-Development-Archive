# Project: Case

Case is an exploratory project into neural networks, genetic
algorithms, and artificial cognition. The project simulates
a robotic device attempting to navigate a room without 
hitting any obstacles or walls. The robot has a few 
ultrasonic detectors (represented by the black arrows) and 
can move forward and turn (its direction is represented by 
the red arrow).

The project has two 
main packages, `caseengine` and `casereality`. The engine
package contains everything that runs the learning intelligence
system of the program. The reality package is where the 
intelligence's environment is simulated.

The artificial intelligence systems drew concepts from a large
host of academic papers. See the References section for a 
sample of them.

## Installation

This directory is an 
[Eclipse Mars IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/mars) 
Java project. The source files in `src` may be used in any Java
development space without need for any extra procedure. Usage in
Eclipse is best done by importing the project.

## Usage

Being an exploratory project, Case is nowhere near complete or
well-polished. In addition, its usage was and is variable. See
`USAGE.md` for the latest usage details.

## Contributing

The project is not accepting contributions at this time.

## History

As an exploratory project, Case does not include a historical
record.
