# Project: GravityInc

GravityInc is an oribital physics simulator. It uses the 
[patched conic approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation)
to simulate and display celestial bodies and their orbits.

The project is a viable product, though lacks
complete documentation and a good collection of features.

## Installation

This directory is an 
[Eclipse Mars IDE](https://projects.eclipse.org/releases/mars) 
Java project. Installation in
Eclipse is best done by importing the project.

The image files included in `gravityinc\render\images` are 
required for the project. If using the source files in any other
Java development platform, make sure these images are available
in the classpath.

## Usage

Compile the project and run `gravityinc.main.Main`. Change the
variable `Main.systemToUse` to view different sample universes.

## Contributing

The project is not accepting contributions at this time.
